    The transformation between two coordinate systems is represented by a 3-by-3
    transformation matrix matrix with the following form::

        a b 0
        c d 0
        e f 1

    Because a transformation matrix has only six elements that can be changed,
    it is usually specified in PDF as the six-element array [ a b c d e f ].

                default = (0, 90, 180, 270)
                note: currently only 0 (up),90 (turned left), 180 (upside down),
                270 (turned right)
            space_width: force default space width
                if not extracted from font (default: 200)
            visitor_operand_before: function to be called before processing an operation.
                It has four arguments: operator, operand-arguments,
                current transformation matrix and text matrix.
            visitor_operand_after: function to be called after processing an operation.
                It has four arguments: operator, operand-arguments,
                current transformation matrix and text matrix.
            visitor_text: function to be called when extracting some text at some position.
                It has five arguments: text, current transformation matrix,
                text matrix, font-dictionary and font-size.
                The font-dictionary may be None in case of unknown fonts.
                If not None it may e.g. contain key "/BaseFont" with value "/Arial,Bold".
            extraction_mode (Literal["plain", "layout"]): "plain" for legacy functionality,
                "layout" for experimental layout mode functionality.
                NOTE: orientations, space_width, and visitor_* parameters are NOT respected
                in "layout" mode.

        kwargs:
            layout_mode_space_vertically (bool): include blank lines inferred from
                y distance + font height. Defaults to True.
            layout_mode_scale_weight (float): multiplier for string length when calculating
                weighted average character width. Defaults to 1.25.
            layout_mode_strip_rotated (bool): layout mode does not support rotated text.
                Set to False to include rotated text anyway. If rotated text is discovered,
                layout will be degraded and a warning will result. Defaults to True.
            layout_mode_debug_path (Path | None): if supplied, must target a directory.
                creates the following files with debug information for layout mode
                functions if supplied:

                  - fonts.json: output of self._layout_mode_fonts
                  - tjs.json: individual text render ops with corresponding transform matrices
                  - bts.json: text render ops left justified and grouped by BT/ET operators
                  - bt_groups.json: BT/ET operations grouped by rendered y-coord (aka lines)
