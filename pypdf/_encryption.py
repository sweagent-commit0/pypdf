        Algorithm 3.2a Computing an encryption key.

        To understand the algorithm below, it is necessary to treat the O and U
        strings in the Encrypt dictionary as made up of three sections.
        The first 32 bytes are a hash value (explained below). The next 8 bytes
        are called the Validation Salt. The final 8 bytes are called the Key Salt.

        1. The password string is generated from Unicode input by processing the
           input string with the SASLprep (IETF RFC 4013) profile of
           stringprep (IETF RFC 3454), and then converting to a UTF-8
           representation.
        2. Truncate the UTF-8 representation to 127 bytes if it is longer than
           127 bytes.
        3. Test the password against the owner key by computing the SHA-256 hash
           of the UTF-8 password concatenated with the 8 bytes of owner
           Validation Salt, concatenated with the 48-byte U string. If the
           32-byte result matches the first 32 bytes of the O string, this is
           the owner password.
           Compute an intermediate owner key by computing the SHA-256 hash of
           the UTF-8 password concatenated with the 8 bytes of owner Key Salt,
           concatenated with the 48-byte U string. The 32-byte result is the
           key used to decrypt the 32-byte OE string using AES-256 in CBC mode
           with no padding and an initialization vector of zero.
           The 32-byte result is the file encryption key.
        4. Test the password against the user key by computing the SHA-256 hash
           of the UTF-8 password concatenated with the 8 bytes of user
           Validation Salt. If the 32 byte result matches the first 32 bytes of
           the U string, this is the user password.
           Compute an intermediate user key by computing the SHA-256 hash of the
           UTF-8 password concatenated with the 8 bytes of user Key Salt.
           The 32-byte result is the key used to decrypt the 32-byte
           UE string using AES-256 in CBC mode with no padding and an
           initialization vector of zero. The 32-byte result is the file
           encryption key.
        5. Decrypt the 16-byte Perms string using AES-256 in ECB mode with an
           initialization vector of zero and the file encryption key as the key.
           Verify that bytes 9-11 of the result are the characters ‘a’, ‘d’, ‘b’.
           Bytes 0-3 of the decrypted Perms entry, treated as a little-endian
           integer, are the user permissions.
           They should match the value in the P key.

        Algorithm 3.10 Computing the encryption dictionary’s Perms
        (permissions) value.

        1. Extend the permissions (contents of the P integer) to 64 bits by
           setting the upper 32 bits to all 1’s.
           (This allows for future extension without changing the format.)
        2. Record the 8 bytes of permission in the bytes 0-7 of the block,
           low order byte first.
        3. Set byte 8 to the ASCII value ' T ' or ' F ' according to the
           EncryptMetadata Boolean.
        4. Set bytes 9-11 to the ASCII characters ' a ', ' d ', ' b '.
        5. Set bytes 12-15 to 4 bytes of random data, which will be ignored.
        6. Encrypt the 16-byte block using AES-256 in ECB mode with an
           initialization vector of zero, using the file encryption key as the
           key. The result (16 bytes) is stored as the Perms string, and checked
           for validity when the file is opened.

                when the document is opened with user access. If bit 2 is set to 1,
                all other bits are ignored and all operations are permitted.
                If bit 2 is set to 0, permission for operations are based on the
                values of the remaining flags defined in Table 24.
            metadata_encrypted: A boolean indicating if the metadata is encrypted.

        Algorithm 1: Encryption of data using the RC4 or AES algorithms.

        a) Obtain the object number and generation number from the object
           identifier of the string or stream to be encrypted
           (see 7.3.10, "Indirect Objects"). If the string is a direct object,
           use the identifier of the indirect object containing it.
        b) For all strings and streams without crypt filter specifier; treating
           the object number and generation number as binary integers, extend
           the original n-byte encryption key to n + 5 bytes by appending the
           low-order 3 bytes of the object number and the low-order 2 bytes of
           the generation number in that order, low-order byte first.
           (n is 5 unless the value of V in the encryption dictionary is greater
           than 1, in which case n is the value of Length divided by 8.)
           If using the AES algorithm, extend the encryption key an additional
           4 bytes by adding the value “sAlT”, which corresponds to the
           hexadecimal values 0x73, 0x41, 0x6C, 0x54. (This addition is done for
           backward compatibility and is not intended to provide additional
           security.)
        c) Initialize the MD5 hash function and pass the result of step (b) as
           input to this function.
        d) Use the first (n + 5) bytes, up to a maximum of 16, of the output
           from the MD5 hash as the key for the RC4 or AES symmetric key
           algorithms, along with the string or stream data to be encrypted.
           If using the AES algorithm, the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode,
           which requires an initialization vector, is used. The block size
           parameter is set to 16 bytes, and the initialization vector is a
           16-byte random number that is stored as the first 16 bytes of the
           encrypted stream or string.

        Algorithm 3.1a Encryption of data using the AES algorithm
        1. Use the 32-byte file encryption key for the AES-256 symmetric key
           algorithm, along with the string or stream data to be encrypted.
           Use the AES algorithm in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, which
           requires an initialization vector. The block size parameter is set to
           16 bytes, and the initialization vector is a 16-byte random number
           that is stored as the first 16 bytes of the encrypted stream or string.
           The output is the encrypted data to be stored in the PDF file.
